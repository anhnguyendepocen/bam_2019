### Handbook for this course is:
McElreath, R. (2016). **Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan.** Boca Raton: CRC Press.

### Additional information on the models discussed during classes:
Kruschke, J. (2014). **Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan.** Academic Press.

### Assessment methods and criteria
The Final grade will be determined by three components: midterm and final exam scores and amount of points gathered from the home assignments (around 10) throughout the semester.

The final grade will be weighted average computed according to the following formula: 30% * (midterm score) + 40% * (home assignments) + 30% * (final exam score) = total score.

Total score and both exam scores should be at least at the 50% level to pass the course.

*Grading scale:*

95%+ = 5!

90-94% = 5

80-89% = 4.5

70-79% = 4

60-69% = 3.5

50-59% 59% = 3

below 50% = 2 (fail)

### Attendance rules
Students are allowed to miss 2 classes without excuse, 2 more classes in case of excuse, but will not pass the course in case of more than 4 absences.
Additional  work is assigned in case more than 2 classes are missed (even in cases of valid excuse).

### Academic honesty
Students must respect the principles of academic integrity. Cheating and plagiarism (including copying work from other students, internet or other sources) are serious violations that are punishable and instructors are required to report all cases to the administration.
