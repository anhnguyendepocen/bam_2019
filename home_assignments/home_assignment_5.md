# Home assignment 5

Read chapter 7 from 'Statistical Rethinking' to understand how to interpret interactions.

Consult [this page](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/seminars/interactions-r/#s3) to understand how to decompose continuous interactions with `emmeans`.

Write a short report and examine whether conspiracy mentality (`cm_mean_z`), age of participants (`age`), and the interaction of both predict belief in Jewish, German, and Russian conspiracy. You should decompose any significant interaction you encounter.

The report should have maximum 3 page of text (single space, 10pt, Times New Roman), but the number of figures is unlimited, provided that they are referred to in the text. I WILL NOT READ LONGER REPORTS.

The report should include the following sections:
- aim of the analysis
- variables used in the analysis
- a short description of the model chosen to conduct analysis
- information about MCMC sampling procedure (whether Rhat and ESS were OK)
- information about results and their interpretation
- at least 1 figure for each model presenting an interaction
- short summary
