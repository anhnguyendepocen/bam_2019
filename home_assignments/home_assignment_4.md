# Home assignment 3

The dataset used during class 7 has 4 additional, potentially interesting outcome variables:
- self-reported anger
- self-reported depression
- self-reported anhedonia
- self-reported anxiety

```{r}
glimpse(real_data)
```

Choose one outcome, and examine how it is related to `zFBK`.
Check all the models we have covered during this class, and choose one. Report and interpret the results.
At home write a short summary of your findings.

The report should have maximum 1 page of text (single space, 10pt, Times New Roman), but the number of figures is unlimited, provided that they are referred to in the text. I WILL NOT READ LONGER REPORTS.

The report should include the following sections:
- aim of the analysis
- variables used in the analysis
- a short description of the model chosen to conduct analysis
- information about MCMC sampling procedure (whether Rhat and ESS were OK)
- information about results and their interpretation
- short summary

**Deadline: 9.12.2019**
