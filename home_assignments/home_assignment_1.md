# Home assignment 1

Your task is to read through chapter 1 from *Statistical Rethinking* - 'The Golem of Prague'.

Afterward, please answer the following question:
In section 1.2.1 McElreath explains one of the reasons why deductive falsification is nearly impossible in real-life settings. The example he gives (see Figure 1.2) comes from evolutionary biology. Try and find an example that comes from psychological science:
- In other words, find a basic topic discussed by psychologists, ideally where two alternative hypotheses are debated (e.g. high self-esteem promotes success in life vs. high self-esteem is an outcome of successful life). Think about process models that correspond to both of the hypotheses, and check whether process models correspond to the same statistical models or not.
- Although the example in the book operates on power laws and histograms, remember that models may also include those that predict mean differences or positive/negative correlations. For example, you may check whether in some cases difference of means (or positive correlation) may support both H0 and H1.
- The example should come from research published at least once in an APA journal
- Provide a graph similar to Figure 1.2
- Provide an explanation (around 250 words)
- You can work in pairs or triads (in fact, probably you should, as it makes the assignment a lot easier)
