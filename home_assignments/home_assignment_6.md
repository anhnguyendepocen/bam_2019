# Home assignment 6

- Read chapter 9 from McElreath - there you will learn about `maximum entropy distributions`. Prepare a simple description of what are `maximum entropy distributions` and why they are used with generalized linear models. Why use more than one `maximum entropy distribution` (e.g. why not use a uniform distribution which has the highest entropy)? 
Your description should be simple - imagine your preparing a description for your peer not familiar with advanced statistics. Word limit: 300.
- Read chapter 10 from McElreath - for each type of generalized linear model presented there (i.e. Binomial regression, Poisson regression, Multinomial regression, and Event history analysis aka geometric model) present an applied example where such analysis could be used. Examples should come from psychology. For each example, provide a reference to the literature.
